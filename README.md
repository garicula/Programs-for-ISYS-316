# Programs-for-ISYS-316
A collection of the programs I wrote for the class ISYS 316 Advanced Java Programming

I took this class at Ferris State University so there might be some variation between the assignments, probably not though. Also I got a "B" for this class, but hopefully whoever finds these files can build on them and do better than me or just use them to check their work.

This will include assignments #1 through #6, along with the two debugging assignments that we had to do throughout the semester

Hopefully someone will find this repository useful, I'll include the keywords for each assignment in this file below. If that's how you got here then just go through each branch of this repository to find the answers you're looking for. Each branch contains a .zip file with the functioning program that you need, and the only two that might not get you full credit are the polygon and the bank teller assignments. Good luck!

General Rules for Homework Assignments
• The beginning comment section must have at a minimum the following or
points will be deducted:
o The name of the developer and the date written
o The instructors name
o The course and section number
o A statement as to its purpose
o The inputs and outputs
o A list of exposed interfaces
o A list of all variables, their type, and their purpose
• Comments are required throughout the program. Doing so will help your
instructor to understand your programming logic and grade you more
accurately.
• You must work on your assignments individually. You are not allowed to copy
any code, in whole or part, from the others. However, you are encouraged to
discuss approaches to the homework assignment with your section mates and
the instructor.
• Each assignment has a strict deadline. Due dates are posted on the Schedule.
Remember that ALL assignments must be completed to pass this course.
• When the term YourName is referenced in an assignment, please replace it
with your name.
Create a new Java Project named YourNameAssignment6 and complete the
following requirements:
